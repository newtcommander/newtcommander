"""Rewrites the predecessor's product identity out of translated text.

The legacy translations were written for Altap/Open Salamander and carry its
product name, its vendor's name, and links to that vendor's sites. None of that
may reach a Newt Commander user (spec FR-018, FR-019, FR-020, FR-021).

What the real data contains (1,361 brand occurrences in 14 forms across the ten
committed languages, plus four distinct URLs):

* prose mentions -- ``Open Salamander``, ``Altap Salamander``, ``Altap Sal.``
* the old binary in command-line help -- ``SALAMAND.EXE``
* the vendor alone -- ``Altap`` / ``altap`` / ``ALTAP``
* **inflected forms** -- ``Salamandera`` (cs gen.), ``Salamanderu`` (cs dat.),
  ``Salamanderů`` (cs pl. gen.), ``Salamanderov`` (sk), ``Salamanders`` (de/nl
  gen.), ``Salamandert`` (hu acc.)
* URLs -- ``www.altap.cz``, ``www.altap.cz/salamander/downloads/beta``,
  ``www.pictview.com/salamander``

**Inflection is handled by keeping the suffix.** ``Salamander`` and
``Commander`` are both masculine nouns ending in *-er*, so they take the same
declension in the Slavic languages here, and the Germanic/Hungarian endings
carry over too: ``Salamandera -> Newt Commandera``, ``Salamanders -> Newt
Commanders``, ``Salamandert -> Newt Commandert``. That keeps the grammar of the
surrounding sentence intact, which a bare replacement would break.

It is not perfect -- a few sentences will still read stiffly, and a preposition
may occasionally want changing. Those are flagged for human review rather than
guessed at (spec T049).

    Only when nothing matched is the accelerator lifted out and the rules
    retried. That covers ``"Position am Salamand&er Hauptfenster"``, where the
    marker sits inside the product name and splits the word that every
    ``\\bSalamander\\b`` rule is looking for.

    Doing the strip unconditionally would be wrong: re-applying the marker puts
    it at the first occurrence of its letter, which is not necessarily where a
    human translator put it. That silently relocated the accelerator in 1,145
    already-translated entries -- ``"Porovnat a&tributy"`` became
